##Week 8
* Algorithms 
  - Is a finite set of precise instructions
* Properties of Algorithm:
  * INPUT 
  * OUTPUT
  * DEFINITENESS
  * CORRECTNESS
  * FINITENESS
  * GENERALITY
  * EFFECTIVENESS
* Pseudocode
  - Is a high-level desciption of an algorithm that uses the structural conventions of programming knowledge
* Finding the Max
* Finding the Min
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

##Week 9
* Bubble Sort
* Insert Sort
* Greedy Algorithm

##Week 10
* Growth of Functions
  * Using Big-O, Big-Ω,and Big-ϴ
    - Big-O, upper bound
    - Big-Ω, lower bound
    - Big-ϴ, both upper and lower bound

* Algorithm Time Complexity
* Division and Modulo Operator
  - Let a be an integer and d positive integer. Then there is a unique Q and r with 0 ≤ r < d such that a = dQ + r.
  - Q = a div d
  - r = a mod d

##Week 12
* Graph Theory
* Graphs - discrete structures consisting of vertices and edges that connect these vertices.  
* Degree - is the number of edges incident with it. A loop in a vertex contributes twice.
* Isolated - is a vertex of degree zero.
* Pendant - is a vertex of degree one.
* Handshaking Theory - 2e = ∑deg(v)
* Subgraphs

* Unions

* Path - sequence of edges travelling from vertex to vertex along the edges
* Euler Circuit - passes through every edge and goes back to the starting point. Has even number of degrees.
* Euler Path - passes through every edge but does not go back to the starting point. Has exactly 2 odd degrees.
