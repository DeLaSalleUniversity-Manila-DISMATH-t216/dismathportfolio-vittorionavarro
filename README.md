##Week 9
* Bubble Sort
* Insert Sort
* Greedy Algorithm

##Week 10
* Growth of Functions
  * Using Big-O, Big-Ω,and Big-ϴ
    - Big-O, upper bound
    - Big-Ω, lower bound
    - Big-ϴ, both upper and lower bound

* Algorithm Time Complexity
* Division and Modulo Operator
  let a be an integer and d positive integer. Then there is a unique Q and r with 0 ≤ r < d such that a = dQ + r
  Q = a div d
  r = a mod d
